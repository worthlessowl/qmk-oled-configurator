# qmk_oled_configurator
Simple QMK OLED Font Configurator. Powered with Django, hosted on PythonAnywhere

Currently working on remaking the website to help with user experience and ease of use. Main page will be a static website hosted with the help of Django. There is future plan to make a wizard utilizing Django's back-end capability.

Tech Used:
- Bulma (Frontend, Layout)
- Django (Backend)
- Jquery (Everything on main editor page is done using javascript)
- PythonAnywhere (Hosting)
- Brackets (editor)

Current Progress can be tracked on the project page on my profile. Some summary on what I'm trying to do next is summed up below

TODO:
- [ ] Implement a pixel/image preview feature, user can hover on the canvas to see what their action will look like
- [ ] Improve on old functions used for processing (refactor)
- [ ] Connect UI element to respective function
- [ ] Connecting the site to Django again, right now, the project is being developed using Brackets, and to aid with the autopreview, every web element is placed on the template folder. Website is not yet working on Django
- [ ] Implement a Wizard to aid beginners on making fonts and adding OLED capabilities to their QMK Project (assuming their board supports OLED)
